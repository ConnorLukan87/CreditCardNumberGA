In any online payment, there is an algorithm that checks the validity of a credit card number entered. A long time ago when this concept was fairly new, the amount of time it took for the algorithm to produce an output (valid or invalid number) would give away how close a person was to having a truly valid number. In this repository, I evolve a GA that simulates this.
